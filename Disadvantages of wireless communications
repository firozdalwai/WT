Disadvantages of Wireless Communication:-

1. Range: The range of wireless network is limited because signals fade and become weaker as they travel through or space.
          Weak and fading signals must be regenerated using repeaters. Therefore, there is a need to install repeaters at 
          locations so as to maintain the required signal strength and quality.

2. Speed: Wireless system have lower data transmission rates compared to wired communication systems.

3. Reliability: Although the electromagnetic waves used for wireless transmision can pass through objects lying in their path,
                these objects can reduce the strength significantly. Bad weather conditions can also have an impact on the 
                signal transmission.

4. Frequency Planning: There must be a carefully planned distribution of frequencies which must not interfere with each other
                       when they are being reused. Proper planning or frequency distribution is also required because only a
                       limited range of frequencies is available and they must be shared among multiple devices to increase 
                       bandwidth utilization.
